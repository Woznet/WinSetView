Follow the steps below to download, extract, and run WinSetView for the first time.

## Step 1: Click the WinSetView Download Link

## Step 2: Open the Folder Containing the Zip File

This can be done directly from the browser, but will look different for every browser. For example...

**Edge**:\

**Chrome**:\

Alternatively, you can open the folder (usually the **Downloads** folder) using Windows File Explorer.

## Step 3: Extract the Entire Zip File

Right-click the downloaded zip file and select **Extract All...**.

Edit the displayed folder path to remove the **WinSetView-main** part and then click **Extract**.

Once the extraction is complete, you should have a **WinSetView-main** folder. You can now delete the **WinSetView-main.zip** file.

**Note**: If you leave the path as is, you will end up with nested **WinSetView-main** folders, but it will still work just fine.

**Note**: If you downloaded using the GitHub release link, **main** will be replaced with a version number, but everything else is the same.

## Step 3: Open the App

Double-click **WinSetView.hta** to open the app.

**Note**: If you do not see the **hta** file extension, check **File name extensions** in the Windows File Explorer **View** menu.

## Step 4: Allow the App to Run

Windows security will not allow a downloaded app to run without your permission. When the following prompt appears, *uncheck* **Always ask before opening this file** and then click **Run**. This message will not appear again for this app.

If you see the following error message, then you either only extracted **WinSetView.hta** or you are trying to run it directly from the zip file without first extracting the files. Please review the instructions and try again.

Assuming you did not see the above error message, **WinSetView.hta** may take 5 seconds or so to load the fist time. This delay is just Windows setting things up to allow an **hta** script to run. Subsequent launches of the app should only take about 1 second.

To use the app, please follow the steps in the guide below...
